Open Godot file called "Title screen" to start the game!!!

I decided to make a music memory game called Tree Friends
The game creates a random sequence and plays it through any of the 4 friends availabe. You must remember the order they sung in and repeat it back by clicking on them. The first sequence is 3 sounds long but it increases by 1 per round.
The art and sound effects are by me, the background music is royalty free music I found online.
You also get 10 points per round. See how many points you can get without failing !!!!

The game features:
    Volume sliders
    Scoring systems
    Buttons that create sounds and change sprite when pressed
    Randomn sequences!
    Retry system
    Main menu with Start and exit Buttons
    Background music and sound effects that only play when you press the button
